# FPGA Architecture

**timing constraints** are one of the central reasons why **hardware acceleration** (especially with FPGAs) exists. When building or researching **custom FPGA architectures**, choosing the right open-source tool to master depends on your **goals**, especially in terms of:

* Level of abstraction (RTL vs. architecture vs. layout)
* Custom vs. existing FPGA fabric
* Bitstream generation vs. architecture exploration

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **If your goal is to deeply understand and design FPGA architectures**, not just use them:

Hereâ€™s a ranked list of the **most efficient and foundational open-source tools** to understand **FPGA architecture design** â€” from **logic down to layout and timing**:

---

### âœ… **1. VTR (Verilog-to-Routing)** â€“ *The Heart of Open FPGA Architecture Research*

* **What it does**: Simulates a complete flow: from logic synthesis, placement, and routing â€” all against a *parameterizable FPGA architecture description*.
* **Why it matters**: It's the tool of choice for academic and research purposes to **design, evaluate, and optimize new FPGA architectures**.
* **What you learn**:

  * How LUTs, BLEs, CLBs, routing channels, switchboxes are defined
  * Timing-driven placement/routing
  * Area/speed/power trade-offs of architectures
* **Used by**: University of Toronto, Stanford, Googleâ€™s OpenFPGA

ðŸ“˜ Mastering VTR helps you **design and simulate your own FPGA architecture**, even before physical tapeout.

---

### âœ… **2. OpenFPGA** â€“ *If You Want to Actually Tape Out Your FPGA Design*

* **Built on top of VTR**, but adds the **end-to-end infrastructure** to simulate, generate HDL, and even prepare for ASIC tapeout (e.g., via OpenROAD).
* **What it adds**:

  * Supports both **FPGA prototyping** and **ASIC implementation**
  * Generates Verilog models for FPGA fabric
  * Bridges the gap between architecture design and fabrication
* **Perfect for**:

  * Those wanting to make **real silicon FPGA chips**
  * Academic/research projects on custom FPGA hardware

ðŸ’¡ Use **OpenFPGA** *after* you're comfortable with **VTR**.

---

### âœ… **3. Yosys + nextpnr** â€“ *Best for Understanding Practical Synthesis + Bitstream Flow*

* **What it does**: Synthesizes Verilog (Yosys) and places/routes it onto real FPGA chips (nextpnr).
* **For**: Understanding how FPGA *toolchains* work on **existing devices**, especially Lattice (e.g., iCE40, ECP5).
* **What you learn**:

  * RTL synthesis internals
  * Placement/routing on hard FPGA fabrics
  * Bitstream generation and FPGA constraints
* **Good for**: Bridging research â†’ prototyping on real boards (but doesnâ€™t design the FPGA fabric itself).

---

### âœ… **4. Chisel / Migen / SpinalHDL** â€“ *High-level generator frameworks*

* **Usefulness**: These are not FPGA design tools per se but **generators** for digital logic (e.g., RISC-V, fabrics, buses).
* **When to use**:

  * To generate reusable logic blocks (CPU, matrix multiply, DSP) for custom FPGAs
  * If your research goal includes both logic + architecture co-design

---

## ðŸ§  **Recommendation Based on Your Goal**:

Since your goal is to understand **FPGA architecture design**, and youâ€™re thinking about hardware that could meet **tight timing constraints** (like 10ns in O-RAN):

> ðŸ¥‡ **Master the VTR flow** and then move to **OpenFPGA**.

This path gives you:

* Ground-up control of FPGA structure
* Real timing evaluation tools (placement, routing, delays)
* A path to generate HDL and eventually a **real chip**

Once youâ€™re comfortable with VTR/OpenFPGA, you can **prototype parts of your architecture on real hardware** using nextpnr/Yosys, and even use frameworks like Chisel to generate flexible blocks for testing.
